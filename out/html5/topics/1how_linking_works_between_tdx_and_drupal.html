                                    10 articles will not update in Drupal. To get those extra
                                    articles to pull into Drupal, go into TDX the next day and
                                    either un-Publish/re-Publish them or make an edit so they can be
                                    part of the 50 for the new day. </p>

                            This leaves 10 extra slots in the knowledge pull for any general
